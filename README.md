# VisibleIsland
VisibleIsland brings a new and simple way to enable and configure the Dynamic Island on older devices.

## Features:
- Enable/disable the Dynamic Island with the flip of a switch
- Fix the position of the Dynamic Island to be under the notch as opposed to halfway under it
- Set the position of the Dynamic Island to anywhere you want using custom X and Y offsets

**Disclaimer**

As of now, the option to fix the Dynamic Island position to directly under the notch is only officially supported on a few devices (list below), as I don't have a huge spectrum of devices to test on. If your device isn't fully compatible, use the custom positioning instead.
 

## Fully supported devices:
- iPhone X (rootless untested, should work though)
- iPhone XS
- iPhone 11 Pro
- iPhone 13
- iPhone 13 Pro
- iPhone 14
  
  
**Note**

Some devices are currently set up using "fake" offsets calculated by setting the resolution on a device with the same size notch and finding a good position for the island. I'm not sure if these will work correctly on these devices, but ideally they should. Here's a list of the "fake" offset devices below.
  
  
## "Fake" offset devices:
- iPhone XR
- iPhone 11
- iPhone XS Max
- iPhone 11 Pro Max
- iPhone 13 Mini
- iPhone 13 Pro Max
 
 
**Version/jailbreak compatibility**

Full support for iOS 16.0 - 16.6.1, currently only built for/tested on roothide (Serotonin) but should ideally work without a problem on rootless as well.
 
 
**Coming soon:**
- More official device support
- Possible iPad support
- Add options to customize the scale of the Dynamic Island
- Fix status bar size to accomodate for the Dynamic Island
- Add options to fix the position of notification banners (underneath the island) and/or set custom positioning
